# A starter kit for 11ty

This is a personal starter kit I am developing as I learn 11ty more. I'm at the starter of that journey so things will likely evolve over time.

## Installation and Usage

Project uses yarn to manage packages and scripts

```bash
# Install from lock
yarn
# Start local dev environment
yarn start
# Build
yarn build
```

### Features so far

- Sass with minification & inlining by default
- Spacing system built from [Utopia.fyi](https://utopia.fyi/)
- Simple `.eleventy.js` config.
